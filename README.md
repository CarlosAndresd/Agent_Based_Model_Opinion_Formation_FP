- Board are good in general for project management. Even if there is no software in the repository. 
- add tests and examples. Teach how to use the tools.
- Add the FAIR cards.
- Start with conda, and if the system is too complex, or the dependencies are too difficult to capture in conda, then use a container. 
- Reproducibility is more than dependencies. Conda can be used to capture the dependencies. 
- Challenge: get someone to test my project.
- How to make sure that the person can reproduce the code and the results.
