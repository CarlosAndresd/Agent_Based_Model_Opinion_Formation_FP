First of all, thanks for wanting to contribute! We hope you can find all the information you are looking for, regarding contributions, in this document. If not, feel free to suggest a modification via a pull request.

## Ways to contribute

There are many ways to contribute, 

- if you don't want to read or write code you may **have a question or suggestion**, or have an idea for **new functionality**,
- if you only want to read code you may **contribute with documentation** either checking or writing docstrings, tutorials, or information files,
- if you want to use the existing code you may want to **add examples** or **add tests**
- if you feel like contributing to the existing code you may want to **write or improve some code** or **implement some functionality**
